# ServerStatus
A Python web server built with Flask to manage the status of a server. The web server will feature cpu management and minecraft server status to provide new server administrators with the tools they need in a simple interface accessible by any modern web browser.
The web panel is still in development - if you very good with building interfaces similar please contribute your changes! Thank you!
#### React panel is in the frontend-development branch. It is not ready to be installed currently
